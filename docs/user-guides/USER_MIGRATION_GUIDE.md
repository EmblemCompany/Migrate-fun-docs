## Overview

The Migrate.Fun Platform enables token holders to migrate from an old token to a new token seamlessly. Users receive Migration Fungible Tokens (MFT) as receipts during migration, which can be redeemed for new tokens after the migration period ends.

### Key Concepts

- **Old Token**: Your current token that you want to migrate from
- **New Token**: The updated token you'll receive after migration
- **MFT (Migration Fungible Token)**: Receipt tokens that prove your migration
- **Exchange Rate**: How many new tokens you receive per old token
- **Claims Period**: 90-day window to claim tokens after migration

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Active Migration Period

**Duration**: Set by project admin (typically 7-30 days)

**What You Can Do**:

- Migrate old tokens to receive MFT receipts
- View migration progress and statistics
- Check your balances and entitlements

**What You Cannot Do**:

- Claim new tokens (must wait for migration to end)
- Get refunds (unless migration fails)

### Phase 2: Post-Migration Claims

**Duration**: 90 days after migration ends

**What You Can Do**:

- Burn MFT to claim new tokens (1:1)
- Claim via merkle proof if you missed migration
- Check claim status and history

**What You Cannot Do**:

- Migrate more old tokens
- Get refunds (unless protected migration failed)

### Phase 3: Expired Period

**After**: 90 days post-migration

**What Happens**:

- Claims no longer available
- Unclaimed tokens returned to project admin
- Must contact project directly for resolution

---

## Pre-Migration Preparation

### Step 1: Check Eligibility

#### Requirements

- Hold old tokens in your wallet
- Have sufficient SOL for transaction fees (~0.01 SOL)
- Wallet connected to the platform

#### Verify Project Details

1. Navigate to migration platform
2. Find your project in the list
3. Check:
   - Migration dates (start and end)
   - Exchange rate
   - Fee percentage
   - Protection status

### Step 2: Prepare Your Wallet

#### Supported Wallets

- Phantom
- Solflare
- Sollet
- Other Solana-compatible wallets

#### Wallet Setup

1. Ensure wallet has old tokens
2. Add at least 0.02 SOL for fees

### Step 3: Understand the Exchange Rate

#### How It Works

- **Exchange Rate**: Displayed as ratio (e.g., 1.5:1)
- **Calculation**: `new_tokens = old_tokens √ó exchange_rate`
- **Fees**: Platform (5%) + Project (0-10%) deducted from pool

#### Example

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[üíº 1,000<br/>Old Tokens] -->|1.5x Rate| B[üìú 1,500<br/>MFT Tokens]
    B -->|After Migration<br/>Ends| C[üéÅ 1,500<br/>New Tokens]

## Protected Migration Refunds

For protected migrations that fail to meet targets. [Complete Protected Migrations Guide ‚Üí](../platform-overview/04-PROTECTED_MIGRATIONS.md)

### Understanding Protected Migrations

#### What Makes It Protected

- Target percentage set (e.g., 75% must migrate)
- Automatic evaluation at deadline
- Refunds if target not met
- 90-day claims protection

### Failed Migration Process

#### Step 1: Automatic Evaluation

At migration deadline:

1. System checks total migrated vs target
2. If below target: Migration marked failed
3. Notification sent to users

#### Step 2: SOL Recovery

Admin executes recovery:

1. Old tokens sold for SOL/USDC
2. Proceeds allocated to refund pool
3. Proportional shares calculated

### Claiming Refunds

#### Step 1: Access Refund Panel

1. **Navigate to Platform**

   - Connect wallet
   - Go to "Refunds" section

2. **Check Eligibility**
   - Must have migrated tokens
   - Shows your migration amount
   - Displays refund share

#### Step 2: Claim SOL Refund

1. **Calculate Your Share**

   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
       A[üìä Your Tokens: 1,000] --> D[Calculate Your Share]
       B[üíº Total Migrated: 10,000] --> D
       C[üí∞ Total SOL Pool: 100 SOL] --> D
       D --> E[üéØ Your Refund: 10 SOL<br/><br/>Formula:<br/>1,000 √∑ 10,000 √ó 100 =<br> <b>10 SOL</b>]

       style A fill:#fde68a,stroke:#f59e0b,color:#000
       style B fill:#fed7aa,stroke:#f97316,color:#000
       style C fill:#bbf7d0,stroke:#22c55e,color:#000
       style D fill:#ddd6fe,stroke:#8b5cf6,color:#000
       style E fill:#5eead4,stroke:#14b8a6,color:#000
   ```

2. **Execute Claim**
   - Click "Claim Refund"
   - SOL sent to wallet
   - One-time claim only

#### Step 3: Verify Receipt

- Check SOL balance increase
- Transaction confirmed
- Claim marked complete

### Technical Implementation

```rust
// Refund calculation
pub fn claim_refund() {
    // User's proportional share
    let user_share = (user_migrated * total_sol) / total_migrated;

    // Transfer SOL from vault
    transfer_sol(vault, user, user_share);

    // Mark as claimed
    user_migration.has_claimed_refund = true;
}
```

## Technical Flow Details

### Migration Flow (migrate.rs)

#### 1. Validation Phase

```rust
// Check project is active
require!(config.is_initialized);
require!(!config.is_paused);
require!(now >= start_ts && now < end_ts);
```

#### 2. Token Transfer

```rust
// Transfer old tokens to vault
transfer_tokens(
    user_old_token_ata,
    old_token_vault,
    user,
    old_token_program,
    amount
);
```

#### 3. MFT Minting

```rust
// Calculate new tokens with exchange rate
let new_amount = amount * exchange_rate / 10000;

// Mint MFT receipts
mint_to(
    mft_mint,
    user_mft_ata,
    project_config,
    token_program,
    new_amount
);
```

#### 4. Record Update

```rust
// Update or create UserMigration
user_migration.amount_migrated += amount;
user_migration.migrated_at_ts = now;

// Update project stats
project_config.total_migrated += amount;
```

### Claims Flow (claim_with_mft.rs)

#### 1. Validation

```rust
// Check claims enabled
require!(config.claims_enabled);
require!(clock < expiration);
```

#### 2. MFT Burning

```rust
// Burn MFT tokens
token::burn(
    mint: mft_mint,
    from: user_mft_ata,
    authority: user,
    amount
);
```

#### 3. Token Transfer

```rust
// Transfer new tokens
transfer_tokens(
    new_token_vault,
    user_new_token_ata,
    project_config,
    new_token_program,
    amount
);
```

### Frontend Integration (MigrationPanel.tsx)

#### Key Functions

```typescript
// Migrate tokens
const handleMigrate = async () => {
  const tx = await program.methods
    .migrate(projectId, amount)
    .accounts({
      user: wallet.publicKey,
      // Other accounts auto-derived
    })
    .rpc();
};

// Claim with MFT
const handleClaimWithMft = async () => {
  const tx = await program.methods
    .claimWithMft(projectId, amount)
    .accounts({
      user: wallet.publicKey,
      // Other accounts auto-derived
    })
    .rpc();
};
```

#### State Management

```typescript
// Track user balances
const [userOldBalance, setUserOldBalance] = useState(0);
const [userMftBalance, setUserMftBalance] = useState(0);
const [userNewBalance, setUserNewBalance] = useState(0);

// Fetch and update
useEffect(() => {
  fetchBalances();
}, [selectedProject, wallet.publicKey]);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Insufficient Balance"

**Cause**: Not enough old tokens or SOL
**Solution**:

- Check token balance in wallet
- Add SOL for fees (0.02 SOL recommended)
- Verify correct token selected

#### "Migration Window Closed"

**Cause**: Outside active migration period
**Solution**:

- Check migration dates
- Wait for claims period if migration ended
- Use merkle claims if available

#### "Claims Not Enabled"

**Cause**: Migration not finalized
**Solution**:

- Wait for admin to finalize swap
- Check project status
- Contact project admin

#### "Invalid Merkle Proof"

**Cause**: Incorrect proof or not eligible
**Solution**:

- Regenerate proof from backend
- Verify snapshot eligibility
- Check wallet address matches

#### "Transaction Failed"

**Cause**: Network congestion or slippage
**Solution**:

- Retry transaction
- Increase priority fee
- Wait for less congestion

### Wallet Issues

#### Tokens Not Showing

1. Add custom token:
   - Copy token mint address
   - Add to wallet token list
   - Refresh balance

#### Transaction Stuck

1. Cancel pending:
   - Open wallet
   - Find pending transaction
   - Cancel or speed up

#### Connection Problems

1. Reconnect wallet:
   - Disconnect from platform
   - Clear browser cache
   - Reconnect wallet

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What are MFT tokens?**
A: Migration Fungible Tokens are receipt tokens proving you've migrated. They're exchanged 1:1 for new tokens after migration ends.

**Q: Can I migrate multiple times?**
A: Yes, you can migrate any amount multiple times during the active period. All migrations accumulate.

**Q: What happens if I miss the migration?**
A: You can claim via merkle tree if the admin creates one, typically with a penalty rate applied.

**Q: How long do I have to claim?**
A: 90 days after migration ends. After that, unclaimed tokens return to the project.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What wallet should I use?**
A: Any Solana-compatible wallet works. Phantom and Solflare are most popular.

**Q: How much SOL do I need?**
A: Approximately 0.01-0.02 SOL for transaction fees. Keep extra for multiple transactions.

**Q: Can I cancel a migration?**
A: No, migrations are permanent once executed. You can't retrieve old tokens after migrating.

**Q: Where are my tokens stored?**
A: Old tokens go to project vault, new tokens are in vault until claimed, MFT tokens are in your wallet.

### Claims Questions

**Q: When can I claim new tokens?**
A: Immediately after migration ends and admin finalizes the swap.

**Q: Can I claim partially?**
A: Yes, you can burn any amount of MFT tokens to claim equivalent new tokens.

**Q: What if the migration fails?**
A: For protected migrations, you'll receive proportional SOL refunds if the target isn't met.

**Q: Do I need to claim immediately?**
A: No, you have 90 days. However, claiming earlier ensures you receive your tokens.

### Security Questions

**Q: Are my tokens safe?**
A: Yes, all tokens are held in program-controlled vaults with no admin access during migration.

**Q: Can the admin take my tokens?**
A: No, smart contracts enforce the exchange rate and prevent unauthorized access.

**Q: What if there's a problem?**
A: Protected migrations offer refunds. Contact project admin or platform support for help.

**Q: Is the platform audited?**
A: Check platform documentation for audit reports and security measures.
